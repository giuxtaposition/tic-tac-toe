## 👩‍💻 Project Description

This is the classic tic-tac-toe game we used to play when we were kids made in `React`.
In this project I tried to "think in react" and follow its best practices.

## 🎉 Features

- Play the game taking turns. (First X, then O) until Win or Draw.
- Keep history of player moves.
- Go back to specific move and keep playing from there.

## 👷 Running Locally

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/giuxtaposition/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
yarn install
yarn start
```

## 🔧 Built with
